## [DARPA Assured Autonomy](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-01-29)

- Goal of the Assured Autonomy program is to create technology for continual assurance of Learning-Enabled, Cyber Physical Systems
-  Utilizing formal methods and other methods the project seeks to advance the ways ML/AI systems can learn and evolve to better manage variations in the environment
- Our focus has been on the autonomous vehicle space, although the technology and techniques being designed are to be transferable to other autonomous systems with minimal modifications
- Funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
- Framework’s used: Robotic Operating System, Python, MATLAB, [NNV](github.com/verivital/nnv)

## [F1Tenth Autonomous Racing Competition](https://github.com/pmusau17/Platooning-F1Tenth)

- Built a 1/10 scale autonomous vehicle testbed equipped with a LIDAR, stereo camera, and inertial sensors
- The testbed’s sensors mimic full scale solutions and allow us to pursue research in perception, planning, control, and networking
- Competed at CPS-IoT Week in Montreal Canda using a potential field control strategy
- Pursuing strategies involving Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, Path Planning, Reinforcement Learning, and End to End Learning
- Development timeframe: March 2019-present
- Languages and Framework’s used: Robotic Operating System, Python, C++

## [NSF CPS Challenge](https://github.com/verivital/VandyCPS)

- Goal of this challenge is to use a quadrotor aircraft with downward facing camera, and other sensors, to scan an area for a lost aircraft, and recover it safely back to base
- Platform used: the Intel® Aero Ready to Fly Drone
- Achieved a 3rd place ranking after one week of development in 2017
- Development timeframe: 2017-Present
- Languages and Framework’s used: Robotic Operating System, Python, OpenCV, C++

### [NNVMT](https://github.com/verivital/nnvmt)

- Purpose of this tool was to address the lack of neural network model standardization among the various verification research software artifacts
- Tool allows for interchange between neural network verification tools and related software, such as ONNX, PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow
- Development timeframe: 2018-present
- Written in Python 3

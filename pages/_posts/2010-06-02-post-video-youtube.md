# Ready Set Race

I have been a participant in the [F1Tenth international racing competition](http://f1tenth.org/) for the last two years and competed at [CPS-IOT Week 2019](http://cpslab.cs.mcgill.ca/cpsiotweek2019/index.html) and at Columbia University. The crux of this [work](https://github.com/pmusau17/Platooning-F1Tenth) has involved developing driving algorithms using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo during simulation, and transferring these algorithms onto a 1/10 scale traxxas rally car equipped with a standard suite of sensors.

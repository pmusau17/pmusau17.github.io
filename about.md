Hello! My name is Patrick Musau and I'm a third year Electrical Engineering Ph.D. Student at the Institute of Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. My research is focused on problems related to ensuring that autonomous cyber-physical systems are safe and function as intended.Â  Specifically its applying these techniques to a 1/10 scale autonomous remote controlled as part of the [F1/10](http://f1tenth.org/) Autonomous racing competition, as well as the NSF Student [CPS Challenge](https://cps-vo.org/group/CPSchallenge). Outside of work I'm the captain of the Nashville Rugby Football club [NRFC](https://nashvillerugby.com/) and regularly compete in the D2 Club Division. I'm also actively involved in Vanderbilt University's Entrepneurial ecosystem in an effort to translate promising ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace.

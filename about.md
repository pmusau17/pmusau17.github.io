Hello! My name is Patrick Musau and I'm a Software Engineer at Google. I work on the Machine Learning Architecture and Performance Team which focuses on improving the performance and affordability of current and future AI applications. It's a nice mix of performance modeling, workload characterization, and hardware/software co-design. Before google I earned my Ph.D. at the Institute of Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. My research was focused on problems related to ensuring that autonomous cyber-physical systems are safe and function as intended.  Specifically its applying these techniques to a 1/10 scale autonomous remote controlled car as part of the [F1/10](http://f1tenth.org/) Autonomous racing competition, as well as the NSF Student [CPS Challenge](https://cps-vo.org/group/CPSchallenge). I'm also actively involved in Vanderbilt University's Entrepneurial ecosystem in an effort to translate promising ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace. Outside of work I love to read, be outside, and get lost in the [vibes](https://soundcloud.com/patrick-musau).

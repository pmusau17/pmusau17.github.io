          "summary": "Safety-critical distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have been found in a wide range of applications. Notably, they have displayed a great deal of utility in intelligent transportation, where autonomous vehicles communicate and cooperate with each other via a high-speed communication network. Such systems require an ability to identify maneuvers in real-time that cause dangerous circumstances and ensure the implementation always meets safety-critical requirements. In this paper, we propose a real-time decentralized safety verification approach for a distributed multi-agent CPS with the underlying assumption that all agents are time-synchronized with a low degree of error. In the proposed approach, each agent periodically computes its local reachable set and exchanges this reachable set with the other agents with the goal of verifying the system safety. Our method, implemented in Java, takes advantages of the timing information and the reachable set information that are available in the exchanged messages to reason about the safety of the whole system in a decentralized manner. Any particular agent can also perform local safety verification tasks based on their local clocks by analyzing the messages it receives. We applied the proposed method to verify, in real-time, the safety properties of a group of quadcopters performing a distributed search mission.",

          "summary": "This paper proposes novel reachability algorithms for both exact (sound and complete) and over-approximation (sound) analysis for deep neural networks (DNNs). The approach uses star sets as a symbolic representation of sets of states, which are known in short as stars and provide an effective representation of high-dimensional polytopes. Our star-based reachability algorithms can be applied to several problems in analyzing the robustness of machine learning methods, such as safety and robustness verification of DNNs. Our star-based reachability algorithms are implemented in a software prototype called the neural network verification (NNV) tool that is publicly available for evaluation and\ncomparison. Our experiments show that when verifying ACAS Xu neural networks on a multi-core platform, our exact reachability algorithm is on average about 19 times faster than Reluplex, a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT)-based approach. Furthermore, our approach can visualize the precise behavior of DNNs because the reachable states are computed in the method. Notably, in the case that a DNN violates a safety property, the exact reachability algorithm can construct a complete set of counterexamples. Our star-based over-approximate reachability algorithm is on average 118 times faster than Reluplex on the verification of properties for ACAS Xu networks, even without exploiting the parallelism that comes naturally in our method. Additionally, our over-approximate reachability is much less conservative than DeepZ and DeepPoly, recent approaches utilizing zonotopes and other abstract domains that fail to verify many properties of ACAS Xu networks due to their conservativeness. Moreover, our star-based over-approximate reachability algorithm obtains better robustness bounds in comparison with DeepZ and DeepPoly when verifying the robustness of image classification DNNs.",

          "summary": "Artificial neural networks (ANN) have displayed considerable utility in a wide range of applications such as image processing, character and pattern recognition, self-driving cars, evolutionary robotics, and non-linear system identification and control. While ANNs are able to carry out complicated tasks efficiently, they are susceptible to unpredictable and errant behavior due to irregularities that emanate from their complex non-linear structure. As a result, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety-critical systems. In this paper, we propose a reachability analysis method for feed- forward neural networks (FNN) that employ rectified linear units (ReLUs) as activation functions. The crux of our approach relies on three reachable-set computation algorithms, namely exact schemes, lazy-approximate schemes, and mixing schemes. The exact scheme computes an exact reachable set for an FNN, while the lazy-approximate and mixing schemes generate an over-approximation of the exact reachable set. All schemes are designed efficiently to run on parallel platforms to reduce the computation time and enhance the scalability. Our methods are implemented in a MATLAB toolbox called, NNV, and is evaluated using a set of benchmarks that consist of realistic neural networks with sizes that range from tens to a thousand neurons. Notably, NNV successfully computes and visualizes the exact reachable sets represented as a union of tens to hundreds of polyhedra, of the real-world ACAS Xu deep neural networks (DNNs) in the new generation of Airborne Collision Avoidance System X.",

          "summary": "This benchmark suite presents a detailed description of a series of closed-loop control systems with artificial neural network controllers. In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network con- trollers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.",

For future iterations, we more broadly refer to this category as AI and NNCS (AINNCS). The friendly competition took place as part of the workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2019. In the first edition of this AINNCS category at ARCH-COMP, three tools have been applied to solve five different benchmark problems, (in alphabetical order): NNV, Sherlock, and Verisig. This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of benchmarks for which these tools are suited. Due to the diversity of problems and that this is the first iteration of this category, we are not ranking tools in terms of performance, yet the presented results probably provide the most complete assessment of tools for the safety verification of NNCS.",

The foundation of our approach lies on two efficient, exact and over-approximate reachability algorithms for neural network control systems using star set which is an efficient representation of polyhedron. Using these algorithms, we determine the initial conditions for which a safety-critical system with a neural network controller is safe by incrementally searching a critical initial condition where the safety of the system cannot be proved. Our approach produces tight over-approximation error and it is computational efficient which allows the application to practical CPS with learning enable components (LECs). We implement our approach in NNV [18], a recent verification tool for neural network control systems, and evaluate its advantages and\napplicability by verifying the safety of a practical Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS) with a reinforcement learning (RL) controller trained using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)\nmethod. The experimental results show that our new reachability algorithms are much less conservative than the polyhedron-based approach [18, 21, 22]. We successfully determine the entire region of the initial conditions of the AEBS with the RL controller such that the safety of the system is guaranteed while the polyhedron-based approach cannot prove the safety properties of the system.",

The first problem deals with the approximation of a vector field for a fixed point attractor located at the origin, whereas the second problem deals with the system identification of a forced damped pendulum. While the verification of neural networks is complicated and often impenetrable to the majority of verification techniques, continuous-time RNNs represent a class of networks that may be accessible to reachability methods for nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived originally in biology and neuroscience. Thus, an understanding of the behavior of a RNN may be gained by simulating the nonlinear equations from a diverse set of initial conditions and inputs, or considering reachability analysis from a set of initial conditions. The verification of continuous-time RNNs is a research area that has received little attention and if the research community can achieve meaningful results in this domain, then this class of neural networks may prove to be a superior approach in solving complex problems compared to other network architectures.",
